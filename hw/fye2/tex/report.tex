$\Q$: \textbf{Can mortality following a heart attach be reduced by taking a low
dose of aspirin daily?} Using the data from six randomized controlled trials
(RCTs), and two models ($\M_1$ -- fixed effects model and $\M_2$ --
random-effects model) the question ($\Q$) was studied. The following is a
summary of the findings. (a) Visually, it seems that aspirin had a consistent
effect in most of the RCTs (see Figure \ref{fig:tcy}). But more investigation
is needed to determine whether the effect is large in clinical terms. (b) The
probability that the control groups' mortality rate is higher than that of the
treatment groups across all six studies computed using a fixed effects model
and given the provided data = $P\bk{\mu > 0 | y, \M_1} = 95.46\%$. This
suggests that under $\M_1$, the mortality for patients (in the six RCTs) who
take low doses of aspirin following a heart attack is reduced in most cases
(95\% of the time). (c)(i) $\M_1$ is a special case of $\M_2$. Specifically,
when $\mu$ has the same prior in both models and $\sigma^2 \rightarrow 0$ in
$\M_2$, $\M_2$ becomes $\M_1$. (i.e. if the $\theta_i$'s are all the same in
$\M_2$, then $\M_1$ is retrieved.) A simple way to decide if $\M_2$ is better
than $\M_1$ is to compare the DIC's of the two models. The model with the
smaller DIC is preferred. (c)(ii) The probability that the control groups'
mortality rate is higher than that of the treatment groups across all six
studies computed using a random effects model and given the provided data =
$P\bk{\mu > 0 | y, \M_2} = 57.49\%$. This suggests that under $\M_2$, the
mortality for patients (in the six RCTs) who take low doses of aspirin
following a heart attack is reduced in 57.49\% of the cases. (The full
conditionals for each parameter in $\M_2$ are included in this paper.)

\section{Introduction}
An intro...

\section{Exploratory Analysis}
Figure \ref{fig:tcy} shows, for each of the six studies, the mortality rates of
the control groups (red) and treatment (blue) groups along with the difference
in mortality rates $y_i = C_i-T_i$ (green). \textbf{Across five of the six studies
(i.e. most of the studies), the mortality rates of the control group are higher
than that of the treatment group.} (Notice how the red line is usually higher
than the blue line, and the green line is usually above 0.) The only exception
is the AMIS study group -- the control group has a mortality rate 9.7, which is
slightly less than that of the treatment group (10.85). It certainly \textbf{seems
that aspirin had an effect on most of the RCTs}. More investigation will be
required to understand why the mortality rates of the control group were lower
than that of the treatment group in the AMIS study. Especially since the AMIS
study had the most participant -- at least double that of any other study.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{\small Mortality rates for control (red) and treatment (blue) groups
  for different randomized control trials. The green line shows the difference
  in mortality rates between the control group and the treatment group (control -
  treatment). A lower mortality rate is better.}
  \label{fig:tcy}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:m1Post} shows the posterior distribution of the mean parameter
$\mu$ in $\M_1$. $p=P\bk{\mu>0|\bm{y},\M_1}$ = .9546. A large
value for $p$ favors the aspirin treatment over the control. So, we would
conclude that mortality following a heart attack can be reduced by taking a low
does of aspirin daily.

\subsection{Models}

$$
\begin{array}{lrcl}
  \M_1: \\
  & y_i | \mu &\sim& N(\mu,V_i)\\
  & p(\mu) &\propto& 1\\
  \\
  \M_2: \\
  & y_i | \theta_i &\sim& N(\theta_i,V_i)\\
  & \theta_i | \mu &\sim& N(\mu,\sigma^2)\\
  & p(\mu) &\propto& 1\\
  & \sigma^2 &\sim& IG(3,1)\\
\end{array}
$$

$\M_2$ \textbf{is a special case of} $\M_1$. Note that $\M_2$ is
obtained as $\sigma^2 \rightarrow 0$.

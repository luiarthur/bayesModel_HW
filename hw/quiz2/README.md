On June 23 2016 the UK will hold a referendum to decide on whether the country
should leave the European Union or remain.  The BBC has bee collecting opinion
polls, starting on November of 2015. These are reported in
http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589. The information on
the web site is organized in six columns. The second column reports the
proportion of polled voters who favor leaving the EU. An estimate of the
probability of preferring to leave, given that a preference has been stated is
given by the ratio of the second column over the sum of the second and third
columns.  Denote such ratio as $p\_t$. Let $y\_t = logit(p\_t)$. We are
interested in establishing if: 

1. There is a temporal trend in the preferences; 
2. There are differences due to the sources of information reported in the 5th column; 
3. There are differences due to the modality (phone or online) of the polls.

Fit a Bayesian model that allows for the exploration of these three
issues and provides a predictive assessment of the preferences.

Remember to use the template provided on the course web page. Start your
paper with an abstract that contains a short description of the problem
and the main findings. Then, the first part of the body of the paper
will correspond to an introduction with a description of the problem and
an exploratory data analysis. The methods and the analysis will follow.
The paper will finish with concluding remarks and references. Tables and
figures, if any, need to be part of the text. Do not append them to the
end of the paper. You have a maximum of ten pages, including figures and
tables. The quality of the presentation will be considered to grade the
paper.

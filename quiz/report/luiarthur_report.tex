Given a data set containing the number of 4 seperate categories of thefts in
California counties, we would like to model the expected number of each theft
in each county. We would also like to know the probability that the total
number of thefts in Santa Cruz county exceeds 3000. A multivariate Normal
sampling distribution was placed on the logit of the proportion of each theft
per each county. A Normal Inverse Wishart prior was placed on the mean vector
and covariance matrix respectively. The posterior distribution of the parameters
are explored in this paper. The posterior probability that the number of thefts 
in Santa Cruz exceeds 3000 was computed to be 12.8\%.

\section{Introduction}
The data provided contains 6 columns: a column containing the names of 39
counties in California, a column indicating the population of each of the
counties, and 4 columns consisting counts of 4 types of thefts (I) robbery,
(II) burglary, (III) larceny, and (Iv) motor vehicle theft. The goal is to
answer some questions about the pattern of theft in the state. Some exploratory
analysis of the data shows that the number of each theft is highly correlated.
This is not surprising because the numbers of different thefts are confounded
by population sizes of the counties. That is, if a county (say Los Angeles) has
a larger population than another (say Santa Cruz), then the number of all
thefts are going to be high (simply because there are more people and hence
more crimes). To construct a somewhat sensible model, the number of thefts per
county needs first to be transformed to the number of crimes per capita in each
county. Still, since crime rates tend to have a small order of magnitude, some
kind of transfomation on a log scale is needed to make computation more
reasonable. The log of the crimes per capita seemed linear. We could model
these log probabilities with a multivariate normal sampling distribution. But,
modeling the log odds would be more sensible because log odds truly have infinite
support; while log probabilities only have negative support. Figure \ref{fig:logOdds}
shows the log odds of each theft per county. The diagonals are the histograms for 
each theft. The upper traingle shows the scatter plots of the logged odds for each 
pair of thefts. The lower triangle shows the correlation. The logged odds
are somewhat linear. Vehicle thefts do not seem to be very much correlated to any
other theft. Larceny and burglary are highly correlated (.93).

  \label{fig:logOdds}
\end{figure}

To provide additional intuition for the data, Figure \ref{fig:mapDat} displays the 
the number of thefts per 100,000 people for each county studied. The counties are 
colored in a way such that areas that are greener having fewer thefts; and areas
that are more red have more thefts. Each color corresponds to a bin of numbers
which are simply the 20, 40, 60, and 80 $^{th}$ percentiles of the data.
Larceny and burglary are the most common thefts. Vehicle thefts and robberies
are not as common.

  robberies (safer) and redder areas have more robberies (more dangerous). The
  different color bins also represent the 20, 40, 60, and 80$^{th}$ percentile
  cut-offs.}

\section{Methods}
The log odds can be modeled with a Normal distribution with dimension 4.  Let
$\bm Y$ be a $39\times 4$ matrix where each row represents a county and each
column represents a theft category. $\bm Y_{i,j}$ will denote the logit of the
number of theft $j$ per population size in county $i$. Moreover, let $\bm Y_i$
denote the $i^{th}$ row of matrix $\bm Y$, and let $\bar{\bm Y}$ be the 4
column averages of the matrix.  Then,
\[
  \Y_i^T | \bm{\mu,\Sigma} \sim \mathcal{N}_4(\bm{\mu,\Sigma})
\]
for $i=1,...,n$ where $n=39$ is the sampling model. A Normal-Inverse-Wishart prior is
placed on $(\bm{\mu,\Sigma})$. This simplifies computation as the prior is
conjugate and the posterior can be directly sampled from. Specifially, if
$\bm\mu | \bm\Sigma \sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{m,\Sigma}/\kappa)$ and $\bm \Sigma
\sim \mathcal{IW}(v,\bm S^{-1})$, we can sample from the posterior by
first drawing $\bm \Sigma | \bm Y \sim \mathcal{IW}(v_n,\bm S_n^{-1})$, then 
drawing $\bm{\mu | \Sigma, Y} \sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{m_n,\Sigma}/\kappa_n)$.
The values of the updated parameters are
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
  \bm m_n &=& \ds\frac{\kappa\bm m + n\bar{\bm Y}}{\kappa+n} \\
  \kappa_n &=& \kappa + n \\
  v_n &=& v + n \\
  \bm S_n &=& \bm{S + C} + \ds\frac{\lambda n}{\lambda+n} 
  (\boldsymbol{\bm{\bar{Y}-m}})^T(\boldsymbol{\bm{\bar{Y}-m}}) \\
  \\
  \text{where } \boldsymbol{C} &=& \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\boldsymbol{y_i-\bar{y}})^T(\boldsymbol{y_i-\bar{y}}) \\
\end{array}
\]
To sample from the posterior predictive distribution, we can simply draw
$\tilde{\bm Y} | \bm{\mu,\Sigma,Y} \sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{\mu,\Sigma})$ using the
newly drawn values for $\bm\mu$ and $\bm\Sigma$. In this analysis, $(\bm m,
\kappa, v, \bm S) = (\bm Y_{MLE},1,10, \bm I)$.


\section{Analysis}
The posterior distribution of the parameters are provided here. Figure
\ref{fig:postMu} shows the posterior distribution and trace plots of the mean
parameter $\bm{\mu | y}$ in the diagonals. Contour and trace plots of each
pair of parameters are in the upper triangle. The correlation between each pair of
variables are in lower triangle.  All correlations are positive. The mean paramters
for larceny and burglary are highly correlated again (.90). Motor vehicle theft
is not strongly correlated with any other thefts. The shaded regions are the 95\% 
HPD's. The trace plots don't show strong suggestions of non-convergence. Note that
this figure is the mean vector corresponding to the transformed data. I have not
shown the back-transformed posteriors because it's more difficult to discuss the 
diagnostics.

    larceny and burglary are highly correlated again (.90). Motor vehicle theft
    is not strongly correlated with any other thefts.}

The posterior covariance matrix is shown here for completeness. The posterior
mean of the covariance matrix along with a 95\% credible interval is included
in Table \ref{tab:cov}.

    \\
    (\bm\Sigma_{97.5\%} | \bm Y) &=& \bk{\input{figs/postHiS.tex}} \\
\end{array}
\]

\label{tab:cov}
\end{table}

Figure \ref{fig:eachtheft} shows the posterior predictive mean, which have been
back-transformed. They can be interpreted as the expected number
\textit{number} of crimes per county. The back-transformation was done by by
first taking the inverse logit of the posterior samples, then multiplying them
by each of the population sizes. The distributions for each of the thefts for
each county was then examined by considering the appropriate empirical means.
As is expected, the blue dots follow the same trend for each theft. They are
only scaled by the population sizes. The posterior means follow the data quite
well for the most part. A way to measure the strength of the model is to
compute the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC). However, the DIC is most
useful in \textit{comparing} models, so it wasn't computed.

Burglary. Third row: Larceny. Fourth row: Vehicle Theft. The blue dots are
the posterior means of the original data. The grey lines are the associated 95\% credible intervals.
The red triangles are the data.}
  \label{fig:eachtheft}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:alltheft} shows the posterior predictive mean aggregate number
of thefts per county. Once again, it follows the same general trend as the
previous plot. The county with the highest expected number of crimes is Los
Angeles. It also happens to be the city with the highest population. This is
not a surprising result.

  \caption{Total expected thefts per county. The highest expected number of crimes is Los Angeles. It also happens to be the county with the highest population in this data set. The data is ordered in a way such that the aggregate crime is increasing with county.}
  \label{fig:alltheft}
\end{figure*}

The probability that the total number of thefts in Santa Cruz will be greater than 3000 
can be computed from the posterior predictive samples for the aggregate number of thefts
by counting the number of samples greater than 3000. Dividing that count by the total number
of samples results in an estimate for the probability in question, which was computed to be
12.8\% (see Figure \ref{fig:scprob}).

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusions}
Using a logit transform on the number of thefts per county, we modeled the data with a multivariate
normal distribution. From the posterior distribution of the parameters, we learned the posterior
expectation of counts of various thefts, and the probability that Santa Cruz will have greater than
3000 thefts is 12.8\%. The model fit the data reasonably well.
